# Pyglit (PYthon GLeam ITerator)

On its core, it's originally inspired from Gleam's iterator (hence the name), I suppose it is not the case anymore?

It's more like a PoC rather than an actual module ; the idea is to experiment on how this could be used
in the wild, and if it is conclusive, then to build an actual project to publish on PyPI.
