# Pyglit (PYthon GLeam ITerator)

On its core, it's inspired from [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam)'s iterator (hence the name).

It's more like a PoC rather than an actual module ; the idea is to experiment on how this could be used
in the wild, and if it is conclusive, then to build an actual project to publish on PyPI.

You can find some documentation [here](./docs/main.md).
